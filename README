This is still very early development.  It does not work at all.  The
dependancies in the make file are not completely thought out.  The exact
conversion process has not been finalized.

To get this to work, you will need the build-essentials and libgc-dev
packages.  Please let me know if there is another dependancy not mentioned
here.

To build (this does not work, yet):
	make all
	
To just create c++ source files:
	make skeinfactory/makefile
	
To remove intermediate files, including c++ source files:
	make clean
	
Be patient.  A full `make all` takes me about 30 minutes.
